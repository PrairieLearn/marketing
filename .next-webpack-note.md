# Why we use --webpack flag

This project uses the `--webpack` flag for `next dev` and `next build` commands instead of the default Turbopack bundler introduced in Next.js 16.

## Reason

The project uses `@next/mdx` with several remark/rehype plugins (remarkMath, remarkGfm, remarkEmoji, rehypeKatex, etc.) that are JavaScript functions. Turbopack, being written in Rust, cannot serialize or pass JavaScript functions across the Node.js/Rust boundary, which causes build failures.

## Trade-offs

- **Pro**: MDX plugins work correctly
- **Con**: Slightly slower build and dev server performance compared to Turbopack

## Future

When Turbopack adds support for MDX plugin functions (potentially through configuration files like `mdx.config.js`), we can remove the `--webpack` flags to benefit from Turbopack's performance improvements.
