## Full-Stack Software Engineer

Are you passionate about building innovative web applications and applying AI to real learning problems? Interested in shaping the future of education? PrairieLearn, an early-stage startup in educational technology, is searching for a talented Full-Stack Software Engineer to join our team.

- **Location:** Fully remote (anywhere in the US)
- **Position type:** Full-time
- **Visa sponsorship**: Unfortunately, we are unable to sponsor visas at this time.

### About us

PrairieLearn is an open-source assessment platform originally developed at the University of Illinois and now used by universities across the US (Berkeley, Princeton, Michigan, UIUC, and others). We power mastery-based learning, interactive question generators, and large-scale exams.

### About the role

We’re a small, profitable, early-stage company (bootstrapped, no VC) and we’re hiring a full-stack engineer to help us continue to grow. As an early-stage hire, you’ll work across the stack and have meaningful ownership from day one. We’re shipping practical, user-facing AI features with clear guardrails and real-world impact — not a research sandbox.

#### Responsibilities

- Work across the stack: Node.js/TypeScript backend; Postgres and Redis; mostly server-rendered HTML today with selectively added interactivity (React/Preact).
- Design features end-to-end, from idea to rollout, with a focus on reliability, clarity, and simplicity.
- Collaborate directly with educators and TAs to translate needs into high-quality features.
- Ship AI-powered capabilities, including:
  - LLM-based agents to help instructors create and test new question generators
  - Vision-language models for grading student-submitted work (e.g., math derivations, diagrams, sketches)
  - Workflows for safely and reliably integrating AI into high-stakes assessment environments

#### You might be a fit if you…

- Have experience with full-stack web development (TypeScript / Python / SQL / HTML/CSS)
- Care about reliability, clarity, and simplicity in systems
- Enjoy working directly with users (many are instructors and TAs)
- Want to own features end-to-end, from idea to rollout
- Are excited about building practical AI integrations, not just demos

Don't meet all of these requirements? If you're a quick learner and passionate about education and software engineering, we'd still love to hear from you!
