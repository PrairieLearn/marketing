The PrairieLearn team takes the security of our products and services seriously.

## Product security

- **Software development lifecycle**: PrairieLearn, Inc. follows a secure software development lifecycle, including secure coding practices, code reviews, and automated testing.
- **Vulnerability scanning**: GitHub Dependabot scans for vulnerabilities in third-party packages and dependencies.
- **Data protection at test**: Datastores with customer data, including S3 buckets, RDS databases, and EBS volumes, are encrypted at rest.
- **Data protection in transit**: Data that is transmitted over potentially insecure networks is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.
