Welcome to PrairieLearn! This document explains the terms of service (“Terms”) for using software provided by PrairieLearn, Inc. (the “Service”). When you use the Service, you’re agreeing to all of the terms and conditions on this page. These Terms apply to all visitors, students, teachers, instructors, administrators, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

PrairieLearn is an open-source learning platform. PrairieLearn, Inc. (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a company created to provide hosting and support for PrairieLearn software at [prairielearn.com](/) (the "Site"). These Terms apply only to software hosted by PrairieLearn, Inc. (the “Service”). If you use an instance of PrairieLearn hosted by another individual, company, organization, institution, or party, you will be bound by their terms and conditions, if specified.

## 1. Use of the Service

Using the Service requires creating an account or signing in with an authentication provider. You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential and otherwise securing your account. If you find out that someone has used your account without your permissions, you should report it to support@prairielearn.com.

To sign up for an account, you must be at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Service. Please have them read this agreement with you.

- transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email;

- accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or
- bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.

We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service.
