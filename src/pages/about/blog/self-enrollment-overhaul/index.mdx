The new self-enrollment and publishing systems are here! These systems should solve a variety of pain-points
with the previous way of managing access to course instances. They simplify access management for course instances, and
provide a variety of easy-to-use controls for managing enrollments and access in your course instance. All the new features released
can be controlled in the UI.

<BlogCalloutBox variant="info">
  **Key Takeaways:**

1. Your existing course instances don't need any changes.
2. Going forward, how students can access your course is changing.
   You can either give them a link/code to enroll (see the [self-enrollment section](#self-enrollment)), or invite them yourself (see the [invitations section](#invitations)).
   There is no longer an enrollment page to find courses.

Let's get into all the new features!

### Enrollment management

You should now use the "Students" tab to manage enrollments, you no longer need to manage enrollments or access in JSON. There are now two
main ways to grant students access to your course:

1. Provide students with a self-enrollment link or code
2. Manually invite students to your course

### Self-enrollment

Self-enrollment allows students to allow in a course as long as they have a code or link to join the course.
You can further limit self-enrollment by limiting it to specific institutions, or setting a cutoff date for self-enrollment.

#### Self-enrollment codes

If you want to allow students to input a code to join your course, you should check "Use enrollment code for self-enrollment".
If they access any link to your course, they will be prompted to enter the code.

### Invitations

You can manage access by explicitly inviting students to your course. These invitations will show up on the homepage for students to accept an invitation.
If you want full control over everyone in your course, consider disabling self-enrollment completely.

You can invite a student to your course by clicking the button on the "Students" tab.

### Managing individual students

Changes to a students enrollment are logged and visible on the individual student page. You can get to this page by clicking on a student's UID
via the "Students" or "Gradebook" tab. From this page, you can also block a student from a course.

### Publishing

Publishing is the new system to determine if a student can access a course.
A course can be "unpublished", "published", or "scheduled for publish".

Unpublished course instances are not visible to students, and they cannot enroll in it or access the contents.
Students are able to enroll in published course instances and access it's contents.
When preparing for a new term, you can setup your course instance to be published in the future. On that date,
the course instance will switch to published.

Copying or creating a new course instance in the UI will automatically migrate you to the modern publishing system.
If you prefer to manage your course instance via JSON files, you can follow [the steps in the documentation](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/courseInstance/#migrating-from-allowaccess) to migrate your course.

### Publishing extensions for individual students

You can grant an extension to give specific students access to the course beyond the original date. If a student has multiple extensions, the latest one takes effect.
These extensions are not written to the JSON.

### Other changes

- Students now manage their enrollments via the homepage.
- The dedicated enrollment page that listed all course instances is going away.
