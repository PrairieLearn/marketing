In the past couple months, PrairieLearn has started enforcing a _lot_ more stylistic and logical rules on our code.
As a startup with effectively 3 full-time developers (Nathan, Myles, and I), this has greatly increased our ability to ship code, and unblock some bottlenecks.

We have since been able to ship code with a lot less "nits" (a minor suggestion that doesn't significantly impact the code's functionality),
which has saved us a lot of review cycles (and time!).

# Background

When I started working at PrairieLearn a couple of months ago after graduating from University of Illinois, 
I was in for a rude awakening about my code. While I have had a lot of experience programming since I was a kid, this
was my first experience where I was writing code that a lot of users would see and a lot of developers would read.
From the developer side, I was making basic logic mistakes like rendering the text `null` in HTML, and failing to consider edge cases.
From the user experience side, I was neglecting basic accessibility checks and rendering bugs. In a large company, this is fine -- you have lots of engineers to
do QA, review your code, and pair program. In this startup environment where we want to ship quickly without breakages, this is 

From a code-review perspective, I was generating **way** more code than could be reviewed in a reasonable span of time.

This wasn't an issue before I had joined, as Nathan was able to single-handedly review the sum of all other PRs.

This was obviously causing problems, and we quickly had to switch away from Nathan reviewing all PRs to
 [sharing the review workload](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team).
